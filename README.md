# comment-worker

`comment-worker` is a Cloudflare worker that receives user-generated content and uploads it as data files to a GitHub and/or GitLab repository. In practice, this allows you to have dynamic content (e.g. blog post comments) as part of a fully static website, as long as your site automatically deploys on every push to GitHub and/or GitLab, as seen on GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, Netlify and others.

Essentially it is a direct replacement for [staticman](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman) and is mostly API compatible.

Please see [Issue #1](https://github.com/zanechua/comment-worker/issues/1) for more info

# Usage

## Setup

Click on the Deploy with Workers button above and follow through the steps to finish the setup.

Create a GitHub app by going to [https://github.com/settings/apps](https://github.com/settings/apps) with the permissions of the following:

![GHA Permissions](https://github.com/zanechua/comment-worker/assets/4265429/a5b7e22d-fc15-4828-8289-b9de3958ee24)

Make sure to generate the private key and download the pem file.

Install the app into the repository you are intending to use with `comment-worker`

You need to declare the following variables in the Cloudflare worker variable settings

| key                      | example                                     | description                                                           |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GITHUB_APP_ID            | 123456                                      | App Id of GitHub App which will be committing to your repository      |
| GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY   | -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----...              | Private Key of GitHub App which will be committing to your repository |
| GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_SLUG | org                                         | Organization name or username that the repository belongs to          |
| GITHUB_REPOSITORY_SLUG   | repo-name                                   | Repository name                                                       |
| GITHUB_REPOSITORY_BRANCH | main                                        | Branch where the site configuration lies                              |
| CW_ALLOWED_ORIGINS       | https://example.com,https://www.example.com | Allowed origins that can send a request to the comment-worker         |
| CW_DEBUG                 | false                                       | Turning debug mode on or off                                          |

The `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` needs to be in pkcs8 format, convert the key to pkcs8 format by following the `openssl` command below and input the private key with `\n` as the separators for the line breaks.

```bash
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in private-key.pem -out private-key-pkcs8.key
```

E.g. `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQ...`

Add `staticman.yml` to the root of your repository. [Example](https://github.com/zanechua/website/blob/master/staticman.yml)

# Manual Deployment

We're using Cloudflare workers + wrangler to handle the deployments, we have to use wrangler due to the features we are using that requires wrangler to package the bundle up.

You need to run the deploy command with the `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` variables before running the command.

```bash
pnpm build
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=abc CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=abc pnpm deploy
```

# Development Setup

Follow the setup section above first.

Create a `.dev.vars` at the root of the repository and the format should follow the `dotenv` format of `KEY=VALUE` and a new line for each of the environment variables

Run the following to load up the app
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
